## Meeting Code of Conduct

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is proud to host this event. This Code of Conduct is one of many
steps towards ensuring a safe and productive environment for everyone. All event attendees,
speakers, guests, and staff are required to abide by this code of conduct, which applies to all
meeting and workshop venues and meeting-related social events, for the entirety of the event.

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meeting experience
for everyone. Harassment includes offensive oral comments and behavior related to gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
concerns, please contact a staff member of CZI immediately. CZI staff will be happy to help
participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise
assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meeting.

A participant engaging in harassing behavior will be asked to stop any harassing behavior and
is expected to comply immediately. CZI may take any further action it deems appropriate,
including expulsion from the meeting.

Thank you for your contributions to a safe and productive meeting. We value your attendance.
