## Logistical Essentials for Hosting a Jam in a Box

So you have decided you want to do a Jam. Outside of knowing which problem you want to work on or which datasets you’re going to use, you will need to figure out some basic logistical problems: Where are you going to host the meeting? Who is going to plan it? Are you going to provide lodging and meals for participants? 

Below, we have created some of these “logistical essentials” to get you started. Check out this [timeline](../docs/logistics/timeline.md) to stay on track with planning.

### Who is going to plan this? The Organizing Team

Hosting a meeting on your own can be a really difficult task. We suggest that having at least one partner or a small team of leaders to help drive the effort. Delegating tasks among the leaders will help for more efficient planning, with weekly or bi-weekly meetings to share updates. 

Example leadership structure:
- *Computational Expert*: This leader should have a good understanding of the computational problem at hand and can drive the agenda to effectively work on that problem.
- *Scientific Grounder*: This leader should have relevant domain expertise related to the origin of the computational problem and can drive the agenda to stay grounded to the science.
- *Event Planner*: This leader will be tasked with coordinating the logistics and facilities of the meeting - rooms and spaces for working, lodging for traveling participants (if necessary), catering for meals.
- All leaders should be working together to ensure the meeting is answering the chosen scientific question at every step of the process.

### Who to invite

The first step in deciding who to invite will depend heavily on your user stories. Defining the problem and the types of researchers you are trying to impact will help define who should ideally participate in your meeting. After reading through the following considerations, use the [Attendee Brainstorm](../docs/templates/Attendee_Brainstorm_Template.xlsx) template to begin generating your list of invitees for your Jam.

*How many participants?*
- For regional meetings, we suggest approximately 15 - 30 participants (including the support staff and leaders) should attend. Larger meetings (>30 participants) are possible but will require extra time for team organization, presentations and report-outs. Smaller meetings (<15 participants) will make it harder to get a good representation of ideas and backgrounds.

*Defining the Level of Expertise*
- The level of expertise of participants will depend on what kind of question you are trying to answer. Is this a computational problem that is niche to a small number of well established researchers? If so, can this be an opportunity to train graduate students and postdocs? 

*Diversity of Participants: Demographics and Knowledge Bases*
- We know that bringing together people from diverse perspectives and opinions accelerates progress on important problems in science. Therefore, it is important to think about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) when building your attendee brainstorm.
- There at least are four axes on which you should incorporate DEI during this process, including:
  - Ethnic Diversity
  - Gender Diversity
  - Age Diversity (i.e. in training, early career, mid career, and late career)
  - Expertise Diversity (differences in knowledge bases, i.e. computational biologists, software engineers, research scientists, etc)

*Attendee Brainstorm*
- We recommend using this [Attendee Brainstorm](../docs/templates/Attendee_Brainstorm_Template.xlsx) template to start generating names of participants. We often don’t know everyone working on the problem we are trying to solve, so we recommend that you share the brainstorm doc with as many leaders as possible to generate names. We also encourage you to reach out to people you know working in the space and ask them for references.
- Note that not all attendees from your brainstorm will actually be able to attend the meeting. We suggest generating an additional 10-15 names of people to reach out to if your initial registration numbers are low.

### Code of Conduct
It is important to set expectations for behavior at a Jam. Setting expectations on the goals and  purpose of the meeting should happen during the invite and at the opening of the meeting, and will set the tone of how participants will work together for the duration of the Jam. We recommend using Chatham House Rules (share only with permission from content generator), and recommend distributing a [Code of Conduct](../docs/templates/code_of_conduct_template.md) during registration or at the start of the Jam.
