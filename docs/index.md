### Whatâ€™s a jam?

Science jamborees, or jams, are small, interdisciplinary working meetings where we dig in deep on a scientific question and work through a shared problem over 2-4 days.

Jams have many benefits:
- Create an understanding around a shared scientific question
- Build capacity for researchers in scientific convenings
- Geographically inclusive meetings with a lower carbon footprint than traveling far distances for a single conference

Jams should be structured such that many groups will be performing parallel tasks (i.e. same tasks on different tissues or in different geographical regions) and will come together in the end to share learnings and resources produced.
