## The Jam Timeline

So you’re ready to jam? Here is a timeline on how to get organized. 

### 4 - 6 Months Ahead of Jam
The further in advance you can start planning, the better -- but we recommend beginning planning about 6 months in advance. Here's what you need to do to get started. 

- Revisit your well scoped computational problem and its definition:
  - Use this definition to establish your jam goals and objectives. Establishing these goals upfront will guide the structure, format and content of the jam.
- Select the dates:
  - Due Diligence: Make sure the dates don’t conflict with any other events taking place in your area, conferences in your field of interest that may limit attendance, or with dates overlapping any major holidays.
- Identify a venue. We recommend hosting regional meetings at your local university or institution to reduce the budget and need for contracts.
  - Determine the requirements to help you narrow down the search. How many attendees do you plan on inviting? What kind of audio, visual and technical support will you need? Is it a space that will be convenient to get to and park at?
- Get cost estimates for your desired number of attendees. Some costs you should consider:
  - Room rental
  - Food and beverages
  - Equipment (audio, visual, internet, data hosting, etc)
  - Speaker fees
  - Travel for staff and attendees 
  - Insurance
- Create your budget
- Recruit an organizing team:
  - See [Who is going to plan this? The Organizing Team](../master/logistics/logistical_essentials.md)
  - Think about staff needs and requirements for the actual jam: will you need help setting up, directing people, and managing day-of tasks?
  - Schedule regular meetings with your organizing team to check in on details and plan content
- Brand and market your jam:
  - Start building out an event website or marketing materials that describe the jam
- Start brainstorming attendees for your jam:
  - See [Who to Invite](../master/logistics/logistical_essentials.md)
- Start thinking about the format, structure and content of the jam:
